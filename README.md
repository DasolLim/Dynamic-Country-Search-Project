## Project Overview

## Objective:
Create an HTML page showcasing details of 20 countries, with two nifty search boxes for finding countries by name or currency code. JavaScript magic is involved in dynamically updating the content as you type.

## Features/Functionality:
1. **Country Showcase:** Your HTML page is a visual feast, displaying information on 20 countries.
2. **Dynamic Search:** Enjoy the convenience of two search boxes, allowing users to find countries by name or currency code.
3. **Input Validation:** Just like in Lab 1, input validation ensures a smooth user experience, preventing errors.

## Language and Tools:
1. **HTML:** The backbone of your project, creating the structure and content of the webpage.
2. **JavaScript:** Adding interactivity and dynamism to the page by modifying the DOM, updating content as users type, and creating new elements.
3. **Git:** Your trusty version control system. Use it wisely, create branches, and make meaningful commits. Push that code to Github!
5. **CSS (implicitly):** While not explicitly mentioned, styling the search results section implies the use of CSS to make it visually distinct.
